# Parent Atlas Workstation Domain Classifier

## ADDED Requirements

### Requirement: Workstation Domain Classifier stays evidence-bound and non-destructive
The system MUST keep workstation domain classifier actions identity-qualified, non-destructive, and traceable to real evidence rather than assumed or fabricated state.

#### Scenario: An action under this proposal is planned or executed
- **WHEN** a component covered by this proposal runs
- **THEN** it records real evidence (source, revision, or receipt) for what it did, and never silently promotes unproven state to canonical/production status.

#### Scenario: Evidence is missing or unproven
- **WHEN** the required upstream evidence, gate, or dependency is absent or not yet proven
- **THEN** the component fails closed (skips, blocks, or flags) rather than fabricating a result.
