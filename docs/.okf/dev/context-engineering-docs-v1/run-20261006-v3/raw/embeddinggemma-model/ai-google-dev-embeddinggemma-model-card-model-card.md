## Model Information

Summary description and brief definition of inputs and outputs.

### Description

EmbeddingGemma is a 300M parameter, state-of-the-art for its size, open
embedding model from Google, built from Gemma 3 (with T5Gemma initialization)
and the same research and technology used to create Gemini models.
EmbeddingGemma produces vector representations of text, making it well-suited
for search and retrieval tasks, including classification, clustering, and
semantic similarity search. This model was trained with data in 100+ spoken
languages.

The small size and on-device focus makes it possible to deploy in environments
with limited resources such as mobile phones, laptops, or desktops,
democratizing access to state of the art AI models and helping foster innovation
for everyone.

For more technical details, refer to our paper:
[EmbeddingGemma: Powerful and Lightweight Text Representations](https://arxiv.org/abs/2509.20354).

### Inputs and outputs

- **Input:**

  - Text string, such as a question, a prompt, or a document to be embedded
  - Maximum input context length of 2K
- **Output:**

  - Numerical vector representations of input text data
  - Output embedding dimension size of 768, with smaller options available
    (512, 256, or 128) via Matryoshka Representation Learning (MRL). MRL
    allows users to truncate the output embedding of size 768 to their
    desired size and then re-normalize for efficient and accurate
    representation.

## Model Data

### Training Dataset

This model was trained on a dataset of text data that includes a wide variety of
sources totaling approximately 320 billion tokens. Here are the key components:

- **Web Documents**: A diverse collection of web text ensures the model is
exposed to a broad range of linguistic styles, topics, and vocabulary. The
training dataset includes content in over 100 languages.
- **Code and Technical Documents**: Exposing the model to code and technical
documentation helps it learn the structure and patterns of programming
languages and specialized scientific content, which improves its
understanding of code and technical questions.
- **Synthetic and Task-Specific Data**: Synthetically training data helps to
teach the model specific skills. This includes curated data for tasks like
information retrieval, classification, and sentiment analysis, which helps
to fine-tune its performance for common embedding applications.

The combination of these diverse data sources is crucial for training a powerful
multilingual embedding model that can handle a wide variety of different tasks
and data formats.

### Data Preprocessing

Here are the key data cleaning and filtering methods applied to the training
data:

- CSAM Filtering: Rigorous CSAM (Child Sexual Abuse Material) filtering was
applied at multiple stages in the data preparation process to ensure the
exclusion of harmful and illegal content.
- Sensitive Data Filtering: As part of making Gemma pre-trained models safe
and reliable, automated techniques were used to filter out certain personal
information and other sensitive data from training sets.
- Additional methods: Filtering based on content quality and safety in line
with [our policies](https://ai.google/static/documents/ai-responsibility-update-published-february-2025.pdf).

### Prompt Instructions

EmbeddingGemma can generate optimized embeddings for various use cases—such as
document retrieval, question answering, and fact verification—or for specific
input types—either a query or a document—using prompts that are prepended to the
input strings.

Query prompts follow the form `task: {task description} | query:` where the
task description varies by the use case, with the default task description being
`search result`. Document-style prompts follow the form
`title: {title | "none"} | text:` where the title is either `none` (the
default) or the actual title of the document. Note that providing a title, if
available, will improve model performance for document prompts but may require
manual formatting.

Use the following prompts based on your use case and input data type. These may
already be available in the EmbeddingGemma configuration in your modeling
framework of choice.

| **Use Case (task type enum)** | **Descriptions** | **Recommended Prompt** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Retrieval (Query) | Used to generate embeddings that are optimized for document search or information retrieval | task: search result \| query: {content} |
| Retrieval (Document) | title: {title \| "none"} \| text: {content} |
| Question Answering | task: question answering \| query: {content} |
| Fact Verification | task: fact checking \| query: {content} |
| Classification | Used to generate embeddings that are optimized to classify texts according to preset labels | task: classification \| query: {content} |
| Clustering | Used to generate embeddings that are optimized to cluster texts based on their similarities | task: clustering \| query: {content} |
| Semantic Similarity | Used to generate embeddings that are optimized to assess text similarity. This is not intended for retrieval use cases. | task: sentence similarity \| query: {content} |
| Code Retrieval | Used to retrieve a code block based on a natural language query, such as _sort an array_ or _reverse a linked list_. Embeddings of the code blocks are computed using retrieval\_document. | task: code retrieval \| query: {content} |

### Limitations

- Training Data

  - The quality and diversity of the training data significantly influence
    the model's capabilities. Biases or gaps in the training data can lead
    to limitations in the model's responses.
  - The scope of the training dataset determines the subject areas the model
    can handle effectively.
- Language Ambiguity and Nuance

  - Natural language is inherently complex. Models might struggle to grasp
    subtle nuances, sarcasm, or figurative language.

### Ethical Considerations and Risks

Risks identified and mitigations:

- **Perpetuation of biases**: It's encouraged to perform continuous monitoring
(using evaluation metrics, human review) and the exploration of de-biasing
techniques during model training, fine-tuning, and other use cases.
- **Misuse for malicious purposes**: Technical limitations and developer and
end-user education can help mitigate against malicious applications of
embeddings. Educational resources and reporting mechanisms for users to flag
misuse are provided. Prohibited uses of Gemma models are outlined in the
[Gemma Prohibited Use Policy](https://ai.google.dev/gemma/prohibited_use_policy).
- **Privacy violations**: Models were trained on data filtered for removal of
certain personal information and other sensitive data. Developers are
encouraged to adhere to privacy regulations with privacy-preserving
techniques.

### Benefits

At the time of release, this family of models provides high-performance open
embedding model implementations designed from the ground up for responsible AI
development compared to similarly sized models. Using the benchmark evaluation
metrics described in this document, these models have shown superior performance
to other, comparably-sized open model alternatives.
