# Parent Atlas Workstation TODO Evidence Report

Generated: 2026-08-10T00:00:00-07:00

This report is evidence-only. It records the current sequencing and conservative phase
statuses; it does not promote any lane.

## P2 transport and ingestion gates

1. Finish the MCP / `/mcp` / `/sse` diagnostics.
2. Keep TRACE core enabled and optional sidecars opt-in until transport matches are confirmed.
3. Resolve Claude-Mem export path alignment before any importer run.
4. Keep the persistent Engram ingestion lane deferred until the transport and importer path are stable.
5. Keep Redis 8 isolated as an eval lane and compare it only after the current ACE context cache lane is stable.

## Registry and retrieval policy

1. Replace the bootstrap feature-gap registry with a live app workspace scan when the mounted codebase is available.
2. Ingest the current feature inventory into the registry and mark each lane as implemented, partial, missing, or eval-only.
3. Keep the retrieval policy explicit: exact cache first, then semantic cache, then retrieval, then packet assembly.
4. Keep single-fact lookups on vector search, code navigation on agentic search, and graph-heavy data on graph lanes.

## Storage, cards, synthesis

1. Build ClusterCard flow from reviewed sourceRefs and table contracts.
2. Keep the semantic cache policy split between Redis exact-card lookup and Qdrant dense retrieval.
3. Add graph refresh manifest discipline with version/hash and promotion state.
4. Wire synthesis consumers only after the packet/version contract stays stable.

## P3 validation and structural promotion

1. Stabilize the 768d -> 64d latent -> cluster -> JSON graph path.
2. Define the canonical ClusterCard -> GlyphRecord -> CHR97 mapping.
3. Keep manifold4 as a later analytical lane, not a correctness gate.
4. Treat the ACE Context Pack Cache / NES Cartridge Cache as Redis-hot-pointer plus Postgres-durable storage only; large snapshot storage stays open.

## P4 semantic memory and checklist mining

1. Keep the semantic indexer as a first-class lane.
2. Keep its outputs consumable by the feature-gap registry without rereading whole corpora.
3. Keep the semantic lane aligned with the ACE/NES packet contract and version field.
4. Add smoke/report outputs to registry rows for retrieval lanes and feature-map lanes.
5. Use LangChain later only as an optional organizer for messy `.md` / `.json` after LangExtract.

## Conservative phase status

| Phase | Status |
|---|---|
| Phase 11 Engram/Gemma4 memory wiring | partial |
| Phase 12 Parent Atlas codebase index | partial |
| Phase 13 feature-gap registry completion | partial |
| Phase 14 Redis exact-card cache policy | implemented |
| Phase 15 Qdrant semantic lane | implemented |
| Phase 16 Graph/KAG/DAG refresh manifest | partial |
| Phase 17 PyTorch feature extraction lane | partial |
| Phase 18 XGBoost / gradient tree boosting reranker | partial |
| Phase 19 reinforcement-learning experiments | eval-only |

## Notes

- TRACE core remains enabled.
- Optional sidecars stay opt-in until transport matches are confirmed.
- Redis 8 stays isolated as an eval lane.
- Engram ingestion stays deferred until the transport and importer path is stable.
